# Capstone_YT_Projectf


The project is about scrapping youtube channel's and videos' data using public
youtube API key, and using python. I have picked five of the most popular channels and their videos to scrape data, using python libraries like googleclient, pandas, seaborn, dotgetenv to create .env files and hide my personal credentials.
Project basically revolve around extracting channel and video data, converting these data to df and finally visualizing them using seaborn. The method used here is list method (developer google page). The out put will a barplot in png format which is saved in the project root folder when run.
Challenges: I ran out of API request quotas couple times, therefore I had to create new API keys. I would suggest please be careful before you pushed your project to github. Make sure your credential isn't exposed, so other could misuse it.
